# pokefruit
Our farm is an NxN plot of fruit trees, and there are potentially five different types of fruits that can grow on the farm: firefruits, waterfruits, grassfruits, joltfruits and the very rare megafruit.
Initially, your farm is mostly empty, with just a few fruit trees placed here and there. However, each spring, the fruit trees will spread to adjacent locations in the farm. Each fall, you will harvest the different types of fruit from all of the trees on your farm.
This program simulates the growth of your farm over time and report the total fruit yield by the time the farm is done growing
